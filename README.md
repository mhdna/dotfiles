# Mahdi's Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. I keep things as minimal as possible â€” no flashy colors, no distractions.

Tools that I use:

## Terminal Emulator: Suckless ST 
I used to have my own build, but as bugs started occuring especially with regards to sixel image generation, I started using [st-flexipatch](https://github.com/bakkeby/st-flexipatch).



## Window Manager: i3

A manual TWM is always better than a dynamic WM.

Along with i3blocks (scripts used are at bin/statusbar):

## File Manager: LF
LF is by far the most feature-rich terminal file manager I've ever used.
For image generation I use SIXEL, which is much better than using something like ueberzug.

## Note Taking: Emacs
Emacs+org-mode for note taking. I wish I'd use Emacs for text editing, but nvim is far comfier.

I use my modified version of arkenfox (See: https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/):
